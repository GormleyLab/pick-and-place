    This is an example utility function.
    
    Utility functions are helpful for:
    - Code that doesn't naturally belong in a class
    - Functions that are used across multiple parts of your program
    - Helper functions that perform specific calculations or operations
    
    This particular function demonstrates basic function syntax in Python.
    Functions are defined with the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
    
    Returns:
        None: This function doesn't return a value, it just prints output
    """
    # Print a simple message to demonstrate the function is working
    print('This is a function')
    
    # You can add more functionality here:

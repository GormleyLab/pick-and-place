"""
Package metadata and version information.

This file contains metadata about your package. It's a common Python convention
to store package information in a separate file that can be imported by both
your package code and your setup.py (if you decide to publish your package).
"""

# The name of your package - should match your package directory name
__title__ = "Name of the package"

# A brief description of what your package does
__description__ = (
    "Description of the package"
)

# Version number using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
# - MAJOR: incompatible API changes
# - MINOR: add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
# - PATCH: backwards compatible bug fixes
__version__ = "1.0.0"

# Package author information
__author__ = "Enter your name here"

# Copyright notice - update the year to when you created the package
__copyright__ = "Copyright (YEAR CREATED), Enter your name here"

# Contact email for the package maintainer
__author_email__ = "Enter your email here"

# Additional metadata you might want to add:
# __license__ = "MIT"  # or whatever license you choose
# __url__ = "https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo"  # project homepage
